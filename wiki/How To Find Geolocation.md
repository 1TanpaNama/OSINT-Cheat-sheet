# How To Find Geolocation (Geospatial)

Finding geolocation is not easy, there are obstacles when you want to find a location for example, limited resources, unclear data and the information you find is not valid. Here the detail 

1. The data you get is poor such as image quality, audio, etc.
2. Lack of information and lack of valid information
3. Lack of data sources such as satellite images, places that are rarely touched by satellites or services about satellites or GIS (Geographic Information Systems)
4. Conflict areas, remote and secret areas that are rarely discussed by the public or visited by the public
5. Your source of information is not real time, you need a lot of real time information and data to facilitate analysis.
6. The large number of identical regions or areas and geographic information in a region (You need to understand each region in terms of geography, houses, settlements etc)
7. Sources of data obtained at night or in the shadows (dim places)

# How To Find Geolocation? 

1. Reverse image, always use it such as Google Lens, Bing, Yandex and other things 
2. Knowing the image or media (IMINT) Understand the objects in the media. Is there a place name? People? Faces? And anything else you can use that clue?
3. Exif or metadata, check the metadata on each file 
4. Improve the quality of your data such as using AI to clarify objects, editing skills and other things that help clarify objects
5. Learn Geography
6. Use satellite imagery and street view
7. Use animation or 3D building to make it easier to find the POV of an object
8. Leverage sun position and shadows
9. Use OpenStreetMap for data mining (OSM Query or Overpass Query)
10. Trying search historical image or satellite (wayback)
11. Trying check nearby about the location (If you has found the location such as building, street name and etc)
12. Find out about the place or region you want to know such as seasons, timezone, buildings, people (faces), language and other things.
