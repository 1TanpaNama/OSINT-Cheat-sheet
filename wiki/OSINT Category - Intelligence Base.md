# OSINT Category (Intelligence Base) 

1. OSINT

Open Source Intelligence. In point one, OSINT search and Collection of information through open sources or the public internet. In contrast to intelligence obtained through secret methods or hidden, OSINT utilizes information available to general. 

2. MASINT

Signature Measurement and Intelligence focuses on collection and analysis of data from various forms of temperature measurements and changes or climate. In contrast to intelligence which is based on visual reconnaissance or communications, MASINT relies on technology to detect and analyzing signals that cannot be detected directly by human senses. 

3. GEOINT

Geospatial Intelligence focuses on geographic or system analysis geographic information (GIS) to collect and analyze geography or satellite imagery. Usually used for military or Speakers for analyzing information from satellite images, information a region and place

4. IMINT

Image Intelligence focuses on analyzing images or footage media such as videos or photos, visual analysis from various sources examples of satellite images, airplanes, building structures and cities. In process
This an analyst will extract information from an image, for example in a mountainous area identifying the height of a plains, terrain and determining coordinates

5. DARKINT 

Darkweb Intelligence focuses on the darkweb. Collection information and digital traces contained in darkwb (Dark Site) Usually used to track cyber threat actors, buying and selling illegal, human trafficking and monitoring crimes on the internet

6. SOCMINT

Social Media Intelligence focuses on gathering information through social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and others. This collection of information can be used to view activity as well as monitoring on social media, the information collected various things such as usernames, posts, trending, dates and other things which can be used to track information

7. SIGINT 

Signals intelligence is intelligence derived from signals and electronic systems used by foreign targets, such as communications systems, radars, and weapons systems to determine the capabilities, actions, and intentions of foreign enemies

8. ELINT

Electronic Intelligence focuses its attention on the Radar Systems and to the analysis of their characteristics. Usually used in military applications, information collected generally does not include personal communications. The sensors used to collect data may be active or passive. A particular signal is analyzed and compared with data recorded for a known signal type

9. HUMINT

Human Intelligence focuses collecting information or intelligence from humans and provided by human resources. For example interrogations and conversations, interviews, surveys, espionage with people who have access to information. Surveillance of targets, uncovering people with potential access to information, approaches to targets

10. OPSEC (Operational security)

Operational Security is a risk management and security process and strategy used to classify and protect sensitive information and prevent it from falling into unauthorized hands or people. In implementing OPSEC, information will be classified and steps will be taken to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities that may occur in that sensitive information. The approach involves analyzing an organization's systems and operations from the perspective of those who could potentially attack and retrieve sensitive information. Several applications in practice such as monitoring behavior, social media, and implementing best security practices will reduce the risk of exposure of sensitive information.

11. FISINT 

Foreign instrumentation signals intelligence involves collecting information from foreign nationals who are testing or using aerospace, surface, or sub-surface systems. Foreign instrumentation signals intelligence involves the collection of information from foreign nationals who are testing or using aerospace, surface, or subsurface systems, related to the testing and operational deployment of foreign aerospace, surface, and subsurface systems. FISINT is not in ordinary human language, but in machine-to-machine (instrumentation) language or in a combination of ordinary human language and instrumentation language. FISINT is also considered a subset of MASINT (intelligence measurement and signature)

12. COMINT 

Communications intelligence focuses information gathered from the communications between individuals or groups of individuals, including telephone conversations, text messages, email conversations, radio calls, and online interactions on the analysis of signals containing speech or text. Tapping voice, text or signal channels is aimed at finding information about voice, text and signal transmissions. That can lead to determining a number of intelligence considerations about the communications, such as signal bandwidth and protocol, modulation type and rate, and the radio frequency used

13. CSINT 

CSINT is Cyber ​​Security Intelligence In the world of intelligence, CSINT refers to and analysis related to cyber security which is used to protect computer systems, networks and data from threat information and cyber attacks. CSINT can also involve the use of classified information sources, such as intercepted communications or data from surveillance systems, typically used by authorized investigators. Examples include specialist analytical and forensic tools, secret geolocation service, A collection of confidential data provided by law enforcement agencies, subscription and special tools

14. Espionage

Espionage is the illegal or unauthorized collection of confidential or sensitive information. Espionage is usually carried out to obtain data of strategic or tactical value, such as military, technical, business or political information. These activities often include infiltrating organizations, monitoring their activities, or using obfuscation techniques to access protected information
