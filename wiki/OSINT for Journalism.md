# OSINT for Journalism

Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) is a technique of gathering information from publicly available sources and is used for various purposes, including journalism. For a journalist, OSINT can be a very useful tool to gather accurate and relevant data.

1. News and Social Media Sources
- Online News Monitor trusted news sites and alternative news platforms for the latest information and context.
- Social Media Use platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn to find up-to-date information, public views and direct sources.

2. Government and Institutional Websites
- Official Government Sites Access public data, annual reports and statistics from government websites.
- Reports and Publications Search for reports from research institutes, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

3. Verification and Validation
- Reverse Image Search Use tools like Google Images or TinEye to verify the authenticity of images and find the original source.
- Cross-Referencing Verify information by comparing multiple independent sources to ensure accuracy.
- Check Sources Cross-reference information from multiple reputable sources to confirm its validity.
