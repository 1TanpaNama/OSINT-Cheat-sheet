# What Is Catfishing 

Catfishing is a term used to describe brazen identity fraud. This behavior aims to lure someone into a romantic relationship. So that you don't get caught up in a romance full of falsehoods and it has many benefits, it is often used in dating apps or online dating

## Why is it called Catfishing?

The practice of catfishing online has been around for many years, simply because it is so easy to falsify your identity on the internet. The term “catfish” became popular after a documentary named Catfish was released in 2010. Afterward, MTV launched a TV series called “Catfish” in 2012.

## Why Do People Catfish?

People catfish for a number of reasons. Some do not involve malicious intent, while others directly seek to harm specific people. Some of the primary reasons behind catfishing include:

1. Insecurity: If a catfisher feels bad about who they are in real life, they may try to create an identity that conforms more closely to what they wish they could be. This often includes using photos of someone they feel is better-looking than them. They may also pretend to have a successful career to experience how it feels to be admired for their “accomplishments.” Catfishers who assume attractive identities may also be trying to garner a lot of “friends” and attention online to feel more popular.

2. Concealing their identity: There are several reasons why people want to conceal their identity online. When no one knows who you are, it is easier to troll people on discussion boards because of the lack of repercussions. Some people intend to cheat on their spouse or significant other and feel the best way to get away with it is to falsify their identity. In other instances, a person hides their identity to extort money from someone else. If the person figures out the scam, they cannot tell authorities who the attacker is because of the catfisher's false persona.

3. Mental illness: In some cases, people who suffer from depression or chronic anxiety may choose to get involved in catfishing. As they assume another person’s identity, they gain the confidence they need to associate with others and live what they feel is a more “normal” online life. With a more attractive, successful, or gregarious identity, they get a self-esteem boost whenever they engage with others online.

4. Revenge: Some catfishers seek revenge on the person they are impersonating. They use the person’s name and face and create an online identity. Then they say or do things online that make the person look bad—or even get involved in illegal activity in the target’s name.

5. Experimenting with sexual preferences: Some catfishers use the practice to explore their sexual identities. They assume the sexual preference they are interested in online, using an identity different from their own. As they engage in social interactions under that identity, they get a sense of how it would feel to live that lifestyle full-time.

6. To harass their target: When someone has been trying to stalk, bother, or pursue someone online, the target often blocks the aggressor on one or more social media platforms. When this happens, the attacker may use catfishing to continue their pursuits. Even though the victim does not know who they are interacting with, the catfisher, once accepted as a friend or follower, is still able to see the target’s posts and pictures. In this way, they can keep tabs on what they are doing, when, and with whom.
A common thread among many of the reasons why people catfish is an absence of self-confidence. When people are either personally dissatisfied with themselves or feel their real identity is not good enough to accomplish a certain objective, they may assume another “self” to feel better or attain the desired result. 

In other cases, the catfisher lacks the self-confidence needed to express themselves openly, but under the guise of a false identity, they feel they can be who they want to be.
