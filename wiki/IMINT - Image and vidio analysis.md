# Image and Video Analysis

Images and videos can provide crucial evidence. Hereâ€™s how to analyze them:

1. Metadata, extract metadata to get information about when and where an image or video was taken
2. Reverse Image Search, use reverse image search to find the source and other instances of the image online
3. Frame Analysis, analyze video frames to identify objects, locations, and people
4. Image forensics, doing forensics on images, looking at detailed information such as changing exposure and looking at other related details in the image
5. Understand the objects in the picture or video, for example a person's body posture, face, building, terrain and other things
6. Measure and identify the time, you can do MASINT to analyze estimates of when it was taken as well as weather conditions and the azimuth position of the sun and where the location is
7. Creating 3D simulation modeling such as AutoCAD and other platforms, this is useful for analyzing and playing with imagination to determine problems with the object
8. Using AI & ML requires programming or coding skills, you can collect assets or datasets such as the geography of a country, faces, buildings and so on so that you can match the similarity of the image if it is not in Google, Bing or other data brokers
9. Check the steganography it is possible that you will find something in the file like hidden data or something else.
