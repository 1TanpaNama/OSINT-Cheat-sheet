# Notes 

You understand IMINT, to map the search, next you know the place to search, for example Jakarta, Indonesia this will help narrow down the search in searching through OSM 

Things to you should take a look:

1. Place object
2. Object of the building
3. Road object
4. Building object
5. Pole objects, lights, signs
6. Billboard or advertising board object
7. Are there other inventions such as license plates? Place names? Building characteristics
8. Measurement on the object 

# Pro Tips 

1. You can navigate in the search on osm or turbo overpass 
2. You can learn through wikimapia to understand the object and the place of the object https://wikimapia.org/#lang=en&lat=-6.225886&lon=106.829681&z=10&m=w
3. You need to understand IMINT, extract information from what you can
4. Verify the data like coordinate and see on the Google maps or other things
