# TIPS 

If you have obtained a vulnerability such as RCE, file upload or something else, you can use the script below to spawn a shell or backconnect revershell. If the shell does not run see below

1. Make sure the target has internet access (internet access opened)
2. Try changing the port to a larger one such as 8080, 8888, etc. 
3. Encode your script using base64 and then decode it 
4. Encode your script using url encode 
5. Check the compiler
